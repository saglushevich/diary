# diary
This is a web diary (with TODO list). The user can add, delete, modify, filter and search for data in his list. This application is multi-user. Used MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, Redux.
In this project I mastered:
+ React;
+ react-create-app;
+ redux, react-redux;
+ react-router;

You can run this project locally just do:
+ `git clone https://github.com/saglushevich/diary.git`;
+ `cd diary`;
+ `npm i`;
+ `npm start`;
